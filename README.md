# LifeExpectancy

This is a regression project, which predicts the average life expectancy of a country based on various parameters.

After performing EDA and data cleaning, various models were created. Random Forest Regressor (after hyperparameter tuning) performed the best. It achieved a score of 93.44% on the test data.

This model was then deployed using flask.
